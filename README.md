# Dotfiles
In this `README.md` I will show you what kind of Aliases I am using and how I configured them.

### Aliases
I use aliases to enhance my workflow. Long or complicated command lines that I use frequently, are shortened in to speed up my workflow.  

##### Alias for testing:
`alias test='"het is gelukt!"'`  
I use this alias to test if my dotfile is working.

##### Alias for connecting my Raspberry Pi:
`alias pi='ssh pi@192.168.1.134'`  
I use this alias to quick-jump to my Raspberry Pi, using a SSH connection.

##### Alias for git checkout:  
`alias gco='git checkout'`
I find this a convenient and quick way to switch between branches.
